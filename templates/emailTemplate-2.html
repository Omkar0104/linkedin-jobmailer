<p>Hello ${name},</p>

<p>I came across your team at ${company} and wanted to reach out regarding any opportunities for a <strong>Node.js Developer</strong> role.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve worked as a backend developer at StartoonLabs, where I built and scaled REST APIs using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and MySQL. I also handled CI/CD pipelines and cloud infrastructure with AWS.</p>

<p>I enjoy working on backend architecture, optimizing performance, and delivering scalable solutions. I'm open to immediate opportunities and would love to explore how I can add value to your team.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve attached my resume. If this sounds relevant, Iâ€™d be happy to chat furtherâ€”just let me know what works best.</p>

<p>Best,<br>
